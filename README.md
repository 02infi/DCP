# Deep cell predictor (DCP)
Deep cell predictor (DCP) is a deep learning approach that explicitly models changes in transcriptional variance using a combination of variational autoencoders and normalizing flows.   

# Installation
To install Deep cell predictor (DCP) via pip : 

```bash
pip install deepcellpredictor
```
Alterantively, one can install DCP master branch directly from github :
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/02infi/DCP.git
```
To uninstall the package,
```bash
pip uninstall deepcellpredictor
```
